# Architecture Documentation

This document provides an in-depth look at the netconf-k8s project architecture, component interactions, and deployment workflow.

## 📐 System Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The netconf-k8s project implements a cloud-native network compliance monitoring system. It leverages Kubernetes for orchestration, NETCONF for network device communication, and Google Cloud Platform for deployment and CI/CD automation.

### Component Descriptions

#### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is triggered on every push to the `main` branch. It consists of two main jobs:

**Build and Push Job:**
- Checks out the repository code
- Authenticates to Google Cloud Platform using a service account key
- Builds the Docker image using a multi-stage Dockerfile
- Tags the image with the Git commit SHA for traceability
- Pushes the image to GCP Artifact Registry

**Deploy Job:**
- Waits for the build job to complete successfully
- Authenticates to the GKE cluster
- Applies Kubernetes manifests from the `k8s/` directory
- Updates the CronJob to use the newly built image

#### 2. GCP Artifact Registry

A secure, private Docker registry that stores our container images. Benefits include:
- Built-in vulnerability scanning
- Integration with GCP IAM for access control
- Regional replication for high availability
- Automatic image versioning and retention policies

#### 3. GKE Cluster Components

**Router Deployment:**
- Runs the `sysrepo/sysrepo-netopeer2` image
- Provides a NETCONF-enabled network device simulator
- Exposes port 830 (NETCONF over SSH)
- Backed by a ClusterIP Service for internal communication
- Maintains 2 replicas for high availability

**Checker CronJob:**
- Scheduled to run every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`)
- Creates a Job Pod on each execution
- The Pod runs the compliance checker application
- Connects to the Router Service via NETCONF
- Retrieves the running configuration
- Validates against compliance rules
- Logs results to stdout (viewable in GKE console)

#### 4. NETCONF Communication Flow

```

## 📊 Deployment Workflow

### Step-by-Step Deployment Process

1. **Code Changes**: Developer commits and pushes code to the `main` branch
2. **Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow is triggered automatically
3. **Build**: Docker image is built with optimized multi-stage process
4. **Test**: (Future enhancement: unit tests, integration tests)
5. **Push**: Image is pushed to GCP Artifact Registry with unique tag
6. **Deploy**: Kubernetes manifests are applied to GKE cluster
7. **Rollout**: Kubernetes performs rolling update of deployments
8. **Verify**: CronJob picks up new image on next scheduled run

## 🔍 Kubernetes Resources Deep Dive

### Router Deployment Specification

The Router Deployment creates a NETCONF-enabled network device simulator:

**Key Features:**
- **Replicas**: 2 pods for high availability
- **Image**: `sysrepo/sysrepo-netopeer2:latest`
- **Port**: 830 (NETCONF standard port)
- **Service Type**: ClusterIP (internal only)
- **Labels**: `app=netconf-router` for service discovery

**Why Two Replicas?**
- Demonstrates Kubernetes load balancing
- Simulates real-world production environments
- Provides failover capability

### Checker CronJob Specification

The Compliance Checker runs on a scheduled basis:

**Key Features:**
- **Schedule**: `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
- **Image**: Built from our Dockerfile, hosted in Artifact Registry
- **Restart Policy**: `OnFailure` (retries on errors)
- **Command**: Executes the Go binary with router address as argument
- **Concurrency**: `Forbid` (prevents overlapping jobs)

**Why CronJob Instead of Deployment?**
- Compliance checks are periodic, not continuous
- Reduces resource consumption
- Provides clear audit trail of check executions
- Matches real-world network monitoring patterns

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication
- NETCONF uses SSH for secure communication
- Service Account credentials stored as GitHub Secrets
- GCP IAM roles follow principle of least privilege

### Network Isolation
- Router pods only accessible within the cluster (ClusterIP)
- No external exposure of NETCONF port
- GKE provides network policies for pod isolation

### Image Security
- Artifact Registry provides vulnerability scanning
- Multi-stage Docker builds minimize attack surface
- Images tagged with commit SHA for traceability

## 🚀 Scaling and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- Router Deployment can scale to handle more compliance checkers
- CronJob can be duplicated with different schedules or targets
- GKE cluster can auto-scale nodes based on resource demands

### Resource Optimization
- Multi-stage Docker builds reduce image size
- Go binary compiled for minimal footprint
- CronJob pods terminate after execution to free resources

## 📈 Future Enhancements

1. **Metrics and Monitoring**
   - Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection
   - Create Grafana dashboards for visualization
   - Set up alerts for compliance failures

2. **Advanced Compliance Rules**
   - Support for custom rule definitions (YAML/JSON)
   - Integration with network policy frameworks
   - Automated remediation workflows

3. **Multi-Device Support**
   - Discover devices dynamically
   - Support for multiple vendor NETCONF implementations
   - Parallel compliance checking

4. **Reporting and Audit**
   - Store compliance results in a database
   - Generate compliance reports (PDF, HTML)
   - Historical trending and analytics
